ServiceStack's new [jamstacks.net](https://jamstacks.net) templates encapsulates the latest technologies at the forefront of modern web development to deliver both a great developer experience and performant end-user UX.

Jamstack (JavaScript, APIs, and Markup) is a modern architecture pattern to build fast, secure and easy to scale web applications where pre-rendering content, enhancing with JavaScript and leveraging CDN static hosting results in a highly productive, flexible and performant system that takes advantage of CDN edge caches to deliver greater performance & efficiency at lower cost.

It's quickly becoming the preferred architecture for modern web apps with benefits extending beyond performance to improved Security, Scale, Maintainability, Portability, Developer Experience & lower costs with your App's pre-rendered static UI assets on Content Delivery Network (CDN) edge caches close to users locations.

These new templates represent the best-in class experiences for their respective React, Vue & Blazor WASM ecosystems each, packed with features & examples common in many websites including Integrated Auth, rich Markdown content as well as TODOs MVC and CRUD examples with built-in contextual validation binding. As such they're now recommended over our existing SPA and C# MVC Templates.
