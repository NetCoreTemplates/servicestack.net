We want to dramatically simplify and improve the experience for configuring ASP.NET Core Apps and make them truly composable,
where we can drop-in files that auto configures itself with both ASP.NET Core and ServiceStack's AppHost so they can
encapsulate an entire feature and provide instant utility without needing to wade through different steps of how they
should be manually configured at different places in your Startup configuration class.
