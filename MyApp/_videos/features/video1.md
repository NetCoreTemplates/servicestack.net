This video walks though getting started with OrmLite - a powerful, fast  and easy to use ORM for .NET that 
can be used in any .NET and .NET Framework App without the complexity of larger ORMs. 

In this tutorial we'll demonstrate the best patterns to use to install, configure and use OrmLite in your Application, 
defining code-first POCOs, using them to create RDBMS tables and explore how to Create, Query, Update and Delete them 
using OrmLite's Typed APIs.
