Having achieved the best architecture for delivering [max value](https://jamstacks.net/posts/hosting) and performance with our [jamstacks.net](https://jamstacks.net) templates, the last expensive vital component used in most Web Apps is hosting of their expensive managed databases. Despite most RDBMS's being OSS and free of licensing costs, major cloud companies continue to charge artificially high hosting costs to provide redundant hosting of App data.

[Litestream](https://litestream.io) lets us avoid these expensive hosting costs by providing transparent per-second replica backups to inexpensive managed storage, enabling latency-free queries, simplified hosting architectures at vastly reduced hosting costs.
