This episode focuses on the new Vue Single Page Application (SPA) template designed for .NET 8. 
It details how this template builds upon the ASP.NET Core Vue SPA template by incorporating 
ServiceStack's high-productivity features. Specifically, API integration, end-to-end typing, 
Vue components, built-in authentication, Tailwind CSS, dark mode, and a Vite Press plugin. 

The Vue SPA template aims to provide developers with a more efficient and enjoyable experience 
when building web applications with .NET 8 and Vue.
