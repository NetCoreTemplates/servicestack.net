To lay the foundation for richer and more tightly integrated UI controls, we've created UI and common component libraries for the
3 most popular JS frameworks:


- [@servicestack/vue](https://github.com/ServiceStack/servicestack-vue)
- [@servicestack/react](https://github.com/ServiceStack/servicestack-react)
- [@servicestack/angular](https://github.com/ServiceStack/servicestack-angular)


All new [Single Page App Project Templates](https://docs.servicestack.net/templates-single-page-apps) have been pre-configured to use these libraries which will make it
a lot easier to deliver new UI components and updates to existing SPA Apps with just an npm upgrade.
