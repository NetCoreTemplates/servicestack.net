The last few years of neglect of Xamarin has removed itself from consideration as a viable development option for 
creating native Mobile and Desktop Apps.

Fortunately JetBrains has stepped in to fill the void with its Compose Multiplatform UI Framework offering 
a modern declarative alternative reactive for creating native Mobile, Desktop & Web Apps that can also leverage
Kotlin ServiceStack Reference for its end-to-end typed APIs.

We'll look at the latest Compose Multiplatform [v1.6 Release](https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2024/02/compose-multiplatform-1-6-0-release/) 
and use it to build a cross-platform Desktop App integrated with a .NET API backend which can both be developed from 
the same JetBrains Fleet IDE.
