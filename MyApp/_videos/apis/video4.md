In this walkthrough, we explore the FilesUploadFeature plugin and its demo app FileBlazor to provide a [Managed Files Uploads solution](https://docs.servicestack.net/locode/files). The FilesUploadFeature plugin is a powerful tool that adds managed file uploads to your ServiceStack application, seamlessly integrating with any ServiceStack service, including AutoQuery services and the Locode App UI.

To demonstrate the versatility of the FilesUploadFeature plugin, we will showcase the FileBlazor demo application, which provides drag-and-drop file uploads to AWS S3, Azure, and local file systems using an all-C# WebAssembly application.
