This episode explains how ServiceStack can now leverage the high-performance JSON serializer 
System.Text.Json that's built into .NET 8. This integration reduces development complexity 
by aligning ServiceStack with the standardized features of ASP.NET Core. 

ServiceStack APIs can now take advantage of ASP.NET Core Identity Auth for security, 
ASP.NET Core IOC for dependency injection, and Endpoint Routing for API execution, 
all while using System.Text.Json for JSON serialization and deserialization. 

It also covers customizations for System.Text.Json, compatibility with ServiceStack's 
rich ecosystem, and how to use the new functionality with clients.
