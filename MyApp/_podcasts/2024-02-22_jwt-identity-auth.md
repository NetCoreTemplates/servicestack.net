ServiceStack. It explains how to configure JWT authentication, including enabling it in 
Swagger UI and ServiceStack's built-in UIs. 

It also discusses the use of refresh tokens for automatically revalidating user access and 
extending the life of tokens. 

Finally, it describes a service for converting authenticated sessions to JWT tokens, 
which can be useful for integrating with external OAuth providers.
