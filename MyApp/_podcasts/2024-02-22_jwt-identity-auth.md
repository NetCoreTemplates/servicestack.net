This episode checks out how to implement JWT authentication in ASP.NET Core applications using 
ServiceStack. It explains how to configure JWT authentication, including enabling it in 
Swagger UI and ServiceStack's built-in UIs. 

It also discusses the use of refresh tokens for automatically revalidating user access and 
extending the life of tokens. 

Finally, it describes a service for converting authenticated sessions to JWT tokens, 
which can be useful for integrating with external OAuth providers.
