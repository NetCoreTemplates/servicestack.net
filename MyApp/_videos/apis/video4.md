In this walkthrough, we explore the `FilesUploadFeature` plugin and a demo FileBlazor App's 
[Managed Files Uploads](https://docs.servicestack.net/locode/files) solution. 

The plugin is a powerful tool that adds managed file uploads to your ServiceStack App, seamlessly integrating 
with any ServiceStack service, including AutoQuery services and [Locode](/auto-ui#locode) built-in UI 
and [Vue AutoQueryGrid](/vue/autoquerygrid) and 
[Blazor Component Library](https://blazor-gallery.servicestack.net/gallery).
