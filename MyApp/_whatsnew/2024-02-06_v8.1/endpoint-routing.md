We're happy to announce the latest ServiceStack v8.1 release supports deep integration with ASP.NET Core's 
standardized features for execution of its APIs.

This reduces friction for integrating ServiceStack into existing .NET 8 Apps, encourages greater knowledge and reuse and 
simplifies .NET development as developers have fewer concepts to learn and technology implementations 
to configure and maintain that are now applied across their entire .NET App.

Better yet, this is enabled by default in all of ServiceStack's new 
[Identity Auth .NET 8 templates](https://servicestack.net/start) which now embraces all these standard 
ASP.NET Core features:

- [ASP.NET Core Identity Auth](https://docs.servicestack.net/auth/identity-auth)
- [ASP.NET Core IOC](https://docs.servicestack.net/releases/v8_01#asp.net-core-ioc)
- [Endpoint Routing](https://docs.servicestack.net/releases/v8_01#endpoint-routing)
- [System.Text.Json APIs](https://docs.servicestack.net/releases/v8_01#system.text.json)
- [Open API v3 and Swagger UI](https://docs.servicestack.net/releases/v8_01#openapi-v3)
- [JWT Identity Auth](https://docs.servicestack.net/releases/v8_01#jwt-identity-auth)
