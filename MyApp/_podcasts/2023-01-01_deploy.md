This episode explains how to deploy a ServiceStack application to a server using GitHub Actions. 
The deployment process involves building a Docker image, pushing it to the GitHub Container Registry, 
and then deploying it to a server with SSH access. 

It outlines the steps needed to configure the server and GitHub Actions, including setting up 
SSH keys, configuring Docker and Docker Compose, and defining the necessary GitHub Actions secrets. 
It also describes how to automate the deployment process using GitHub Releases and how to 
perform rollbacks to previous releases.
