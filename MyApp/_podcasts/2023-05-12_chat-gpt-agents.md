This episode looks at how to create "ChatGPT Agents" that can leverage ServiceStack APIs to 
perform tasks. 

It demonstrates how to give ChatGPT access to a developer's APIs through prompting techniques 
that enable the AI to reason about the context of a conversation and make decisions about which 
API to use. 

This is achieved through a combination of technologies, including ChatGPT's large language models, 
chain-of-thought prompting, and in-context learning. 

It also highlights the importance of providing clear descriptions and definitions of the APIs 
so that the Agent can understand how and when to use them. 

It concludes by discussing a proof-of-concept project called "GptMeetingAgent" that demonstrates 
how to build an Agent that can book meetings with colleagues, showcasing the potential of 
ChatGPT Agents to automate complex tasks.
