This episode does a deep dive into CreatorKit - a free, open-source, self-hosted alternative 
to Mailchimp and Disqus that provides features such as email management, newsletter subscriptions, 
commenting, voting, and moderation for static websites. 

It's designed to enhance the functionality of websites built with JAMStack or Razor SSG, 
allowing users to manage mailing lists, email campaigns, and community interactions 
from a centralized platform. 

CreatorKit offers a user-friendly interface, customizable email templates, and seamless 
integration with existing websites, while also providing a privacy-focused solution for 
those who prefer to keep their data self-hosted. 

The developers plan to expand CreatorKit's capabilities with features like commerce integration, 
Stripe integration, and more in the future.
