This episode of ServiceStack Podcast features an in-depth discussion about the latest ServiceStack 
v8.3 release that introduces several new features, including an improved Commands feature for 
structuring internal logic, a new API Keys feature for securing APIs, and a solution to the 
incompatibility with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9's hardened cryptography policies. 

The Commands feature allows for better code reuse, testability, and observability, while the 
API Keys feature provides fine-grained access control and simplifies authentication for 
microservices. The updated license key generation process enables compatibility with RHEL 9, 
and a DOM XSS vulnerability has been fixed in the built-in Login page.
