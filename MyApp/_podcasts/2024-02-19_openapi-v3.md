This episode looks at ServiceStack v8.1's new way to integrate ServiceStack APIs into 
ASP.NET Core applications by mapping them to standard ASP.NET Core endpoints. 
This integration enables ServiceStack APIs to use third-party tooling, like the OpenAPI v3 
specification generation offered by the Swashbuckle.AspNetCore package. 

The new approach allows for greater customization of the OpenAPI specification, providing more 
control over how ServiceStack APIs are presented to users. This customization can be achieved 
using the Swashbuckle library's SchemaFilter and OperationFilter options, which allow developers 
to adjust the structure and presentation of API documentation in Swagger UI.
