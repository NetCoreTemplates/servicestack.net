Before we get into unpacking this release we're happy to announce that we've now eclipsed **10 years** since our
[first commit](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/commit/2a9cd0d10247ae1a679ac011d7bdef593937dba4)!

I'd like to take this milestone to thank our thousands of Customers we've had the pleasure to serve and see our Software used which has amassed
more than **27,000,000+ total downloads** on NuGet and to see the uptick in adoption of some of our unique features like
[Add ServiceStack Reference](https://docs.servicestack.net/add-servicestack-reference) which has been used more than **88,000 times**
to generate native Typed DTOs amongst its [8 supported languages](https://docs.servicestack.net/add-servicestack-reference#supported-languages).
