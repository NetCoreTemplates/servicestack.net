Razor Press is a **Razor Pages** and **Markdown** powered alternative to Ruby's Jekyll & Vue's VitePress that's ideal for
generating fast, static content-centric & documentation websites. Inspired by [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev),
it's designed to effortlessly create documentation around content written in Markdown, rendered using C# Razor Pages
that's beautifully styled with [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com) and [@tailwindcss/typography](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/typography-plugin).

The resulting statically generated HTML pages can be easily deployed anywhere, where it can be hosted by any HTTP Server or CDN.
By default it includes GitHub Actions to deploy it your GitHub Repo's **gh-pages** branch where it's hosted for FREE
on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) CDN which can be easily configured to use your
[Custom Domain](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site).
