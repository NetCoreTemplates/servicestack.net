[Managed Files Uploads](https://docs.servicestack.net/locode/files) is a high-level ServiceStack feature that allows you to 
configure multiple managed file upload locations within the same App that any ServiceStack HTTP API can declaratively annotate 
on Request DTOs to upload files to AWS S3, Azure Blob storage or internal File Systems.
