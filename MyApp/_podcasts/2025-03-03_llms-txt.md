This episode introduces the adoption of `llms.txt` and `llms-full.txt` files in Razor SSG and Razor Press 
to improve the efficiency and accuracy of Large Language Models (LLMs). 

These files provide LLMs with clean, structured markdown content, filtering out the noise and complexity of 
typical HTML pages. Markdown's lightweight nature ensures LLMs receive high-quality, contextually relevant 
information. 

Razor SSG and Razor Press now automatically generate these files from website markdown content, enhancing 
content ingestion for AI applications. This support streamlines the process of feeding websites' information 
to LLMs, thereby optimizing their performance.
