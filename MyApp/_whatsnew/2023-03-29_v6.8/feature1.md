We're celebrating reaching **150M Total Downloads** with a brand new website, rewritten from Ruby's Jekyll and jQuery with an exciting 
new Razor SSG project template enhanced with Vue 3 components for client interactivity features.

The new Razor Pages & Markdown powered template takes advantage of the advances made in the last few releases with our npm 
dependency-free approach to [Simple, Modern JavaScript](/posts/javascript), the built-in support for 
[Prerendering Razor Pages](/posts/prerendering) and the rich Tailwind 
[Vue Component Library](https://docs.servicestack.net/vue/) to create an enjoyable experience for creating Fast, FREE, 
beautiful, CDN-hostable static generated websites & blogs.
