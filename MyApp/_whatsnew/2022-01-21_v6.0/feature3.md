Our new Blazor WebAssembly (WASM) template is ideal for teams with strong C# skills building Line Of Business (LOB) applications. Utilizing an API First development model, the C# Blazor front-end is able to take advantage of the clean separation of ServiceStack APIs to enjoy instant frictionless 100% reuse of API Types as-is, without any reliance on any tooling or unproductive out-of-sync code-gen build steps interrupting developers workflow.

Together with new .NET Service Clients Apis it results in the ideal productive dev model to bind Blazor UIs to ServiceStack APIs.

Templates make use of **ServiceStack.Blazor** a new package of integrated functionality with ServiceStack, inc. JSON API HttpClient Factory, API-enabled base components & themable Bootstrap + Tailwind UI controls.

In addition to TODO MVC and CRUD UI examples demonstrating its productive dev model, it also includes pre-rendering solutions for instant load times & GitHub Actions for effortless optimal Jamstack CDN deployments.
