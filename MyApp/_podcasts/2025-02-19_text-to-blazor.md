This episode covers "Text to Blazor," a tool using AI to generate Blazor Admin CRUD applications from 
text descriptions.  It leverages AI to create data models in TypeScript, a format easily interpreted by 
both AI and developers, which then drives the generation of APIs, database migrations, and user interfaces.  

The tool offers both "Admin Only" and "UI + Admin" application templates, prioritizing modular code generation 
for maintainability.  

Users can customize data models via TypeScript files, influencing generated code, and manage database changes 
via provided npm scripts.  

The system supports audit trails and offers options for handling attributes and custom APIs.
