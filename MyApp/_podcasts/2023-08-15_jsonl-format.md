This episode provides a detailed guide to using the JSON Lines (JSONL) format for 
data serialization and deserialization in ServiceStack. 

It emphasizes the advantages of JSONL's streamable nature for handling large datasets efficiently, 
particularly in the context of building data pipelines and interacting with AI-generated content. 

It offers practical examples of implementing JSONL serialization and deserialization within 
ServiceStack endpoints, using various approaches such as automatic serialization with AutoQuery, 
configuring Request and Response DTOs, and utilizing the JsonlSerializer class. 

It also demonstrates a real-world application of JSONL for indexing AI-generated art albums 
using the Blazor Diffusion API and Typesense, showcasing how the format facilitates efficient 
data indexing and retrieval.
