The episode contains a detailed explanation of the new features of ServiceStack v8 whose
most significant update is the adoption of ASP.NET Core Identity Auth for authentication, 
replacing ServiceStack's traditional authentication system. 

ServiceStack v8 also introduces a new Blazor template that leverages the benefits of .NET 8's 
enhanced navigation and static rendering for a faster, more efficient user experience. 

It also discusses the introduction of PHP support for ServiceStack's "Add ServiceStack Reference" 
feature, enabling PHP developers to easily generate typed PHP DTOs for consuming ServiceStack APIs.
