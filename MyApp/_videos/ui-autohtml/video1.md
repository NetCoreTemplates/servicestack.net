The Auto HTML Page provides instant utility for API consumers in consuming your APIs with a built-in 
API Response Visualizer, JSON syntax highlighting, integrated Postman-like UI and API SDK integration all-in-one.

Powered by Vue 3 and the ServiceStack [Vue library](https://docs.servicestack.net/vue/), it's also highly customizable.
