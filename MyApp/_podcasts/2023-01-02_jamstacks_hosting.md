The episode describes the cost benefits and architectural advantages of adopting a Jamstack 
approach for web application development. It outlines how using a combination of static content 
served through a CDN and a separate .NET server for dynamic functionality leads to significantly 
cheaper hosting costs, due to the free CDN service offered by GitHub Pages. 

It also highlights how this architecture enhances security, scalability, maintainability, 
portability, and developer experience. By leveraging pre-built static assets and decoupling the UI 
from the backend, the Jamstack approach allows for a more efficient and cost-effective way to build 
and deploy modern web applications.
