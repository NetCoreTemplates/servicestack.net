With ServiceStack now fully integrated with .NET 8, our focus has shifted from providing platform-agnostic solutions 
that supports all ServiceStack's .NET Framework and .NET hosts to building on the new capabilities of .NET 8 by 
enhancing ASP .NET Core's built-in features and templates with ServiceStack's high-productivity features.

### New Vue SPA Template

The latest Vue SPA template is a good example of this, building on and enhancing the built-in ASP.NET Core Vue SPA 
template with many high-productivity features:

- ASP.NET Core Identity Auth Integration
- End-to-end Typed TypeScript APIs
- Beautiful Tailwind CSS with Dark Mode
- Universal Vite Press Plugin Markdown features
- Highly Productive Vue Component Library
- Effortless CRUD and Admin UIs with AutoQueryGrid
