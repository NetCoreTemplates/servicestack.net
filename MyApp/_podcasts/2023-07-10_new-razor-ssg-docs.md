This episode discusses the migration of the docs.servicestack.net website from VitePress to 
Razor SSG. The migration was driven by issues encountered with VitePress's SSR/SPA model, 
which resulted in duplicate content and rendering problems. 

Razor SSG, a C# and Razor Pages-based static site generator, provided a more stable and 
flexible solution. The benefits of Razor SSG include improved performance, a cleaner 
HTML structure, dark mode support, and the ability to use Markdown, Razor, or a 
hybrid mix of both for page content. 

It also highlights the development of a new Razor SSG project template called "Razor Press" 
which offers a free and efficient way to create documentation and content-centric websites 
using Razor Pages, Tailwind CSS, and Markdown. 

The migration of docs.servicestack.net from VitePress to Razor SSG and the subsequent development 
of Razor Press demonstrate the potential of Razor SSG for creating fast, reliable, and feature-rich 
static websites.
