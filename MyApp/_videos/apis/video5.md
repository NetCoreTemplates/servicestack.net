[Post Command](https://docs.servicestack.net/post-command) is a collection of command line utils that lets you easily discover, 
inspect and invoke ServiceStack endpoints from a single command.

The [inspect](https://docs.servicestack.net/post-command#inspect-command) and send features added to the dotnet x tool make it easy to inspect metadata and data from ServiceStack services, as well as automate tasks using data from your web service APIs. With inspect, developers can easily view the metadata of their ServiceStack services, including the available routes, request and response DTOs, and any custom metadata attributes.

The [send](https://docs.servicestack.net/post-command#send-invoking-apis) command allows developers to easily send requests to their ServiceStack services using the command line. This feature is particularly useful for automating tasks.
