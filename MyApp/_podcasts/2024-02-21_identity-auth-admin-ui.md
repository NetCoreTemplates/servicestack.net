This episode talks about the new Identity Auth Admin UI for managing users in ASP.NET Core 8 applications. 
The UI offers features like creating, searching, and editing users, but it can be customized to 
display user data and search results based on custom properties. 

The UI also includes features for managing user roles, locking users out, and changing passwords, 
but these can be adjusted and extended to include custom fields and validation logic 
and make use of events for executing custom logic during user creation, updates, and deletions.
