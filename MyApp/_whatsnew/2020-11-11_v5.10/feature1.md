To see the rapid development of AutoQuery in action we've created a quick demo showing how to create a simple multi-user Booking System from an empty [web](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/web) project, [mixed in](https://docs.servicestack.net/mix-tool) with the preferred RDBMS & Auth layered functionality, before enabling [Validation](https://docs.servicestack.net/validation), [AutoQuery](https://docs.servicestack.net/autoquery-rdbms), Admin Users & [CRUD Event Log](https://docs.servicestack.net/autoquery-audit-log) plugins - to lay the foundational features before building our App by first defining its `Booking` data model & its surrounding **Query**, **Create**, **Update** and **Soft Delete** Typed CRUD APIs with rich validation enforced by declarative Validation attributes and multi-layer authorization rules & access permissions protected using Authorization attributes.
