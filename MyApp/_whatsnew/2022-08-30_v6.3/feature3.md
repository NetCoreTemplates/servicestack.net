The new built-in Database Admin UI lets you quickly browse your App's configured RDBMS schemas and tables, which without any additional configuration your App's configured databases, their schemas, tables and any registered [named connections](https://docs.servicestack.net/ormlite/getting-started#multiple-database-connections) will be navigable from the home page where they'll be browsable with a familiar tabular search results grid, similar in appearance and functionality to [Locode's Auto UI](https://locode.dev) where their resultsets can each be personalized with flexible query preferences and filtering options that's persisted across browser restarts.
