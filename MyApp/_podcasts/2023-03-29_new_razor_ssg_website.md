ServiceStack has reached 150 million downloads! To celebrate this milestone, we've launched 
a new website built using our home-grown Razor SSG static site generator written in C# and Razor. 

The new website replaces their previous site built with Jekyll, a Ruby-based generator. 

This solution was chosen due to their dissatisfaction with the increasing complexity 
and maintenance issues of existing SSG tools. 

This new approach offers a more streamlined and efficient development experience and also allows 
leveraging existing expertise in C# and .NET libraries, making the site more maintainable.
