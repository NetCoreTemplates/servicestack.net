Locode's declarative dev model lets you focus on your new App's business requirements where its data model, API capabilities, input validation & multi-user Auth restrictions can be defined simply using annotated C# POCOs.
This provides immense value at the start of the development cycle where functional prototypes can be quickly iterated to gather business requirements

Once requirements have solidified, its typed AutoQuery APIs can easily be reused to develop custom UIs to optimize important workflows.

[Talent Blazor](https://github.com/NetCoreApps/TalentBlazor) is a new App showcasing an example of this where its entire back-office functionality can be managed through Locode whilst an optimized **Blazor WASM App** is created to optimize its unique workflow requirements which also benefits from the superior productive dev model of its Typed APIs.
