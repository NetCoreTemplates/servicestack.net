The new [Blazor Vue](/posts/net8-best-blazor) template is ideal for building Fast, SEO-friendly, 100% statically rendered Blazor Web Apps where 
all its dynamic functionally uses Vue.js to progressively enhance Blazor's statically rendered content - eliminating Blazor's 
current limitations of being able to use Blazor SSR to develop an entire App without any of Blazor Interactivity downsides.

The [blazor-vue](/posts/net8-best-blazor) template reimplements all features of the [blazor](/posts/net8-blazor-template) 
template with all its interactive features created with **Vue.js** and the 
[Vue Components library](https://docs.servicestack.net/vue/), with both templates combining the latest advancements in 
Blazor .NET 8 with **Tailwind CSS** styling for creating beautiful Responsive Websites with support for Dark Mode.
