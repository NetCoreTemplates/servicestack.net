The last few years of neglect of Xamarin has slid it into irrelevance, removing itself from consideration in the already 
shortlist of viable development options for creating native multi-platform iOS, Android and Desktop Apps,

Fortunately JetBrains has stepped in to fill the void with Compose Multiplatform offering a modern alternative for creating 
native Mobile, Desktop & Web Apps which can also leverage Kotlin ServiceStack Reference for end-to-end typed APIs.

We'll look at the latest Compose Multiplatform v1.6 Release and use it to build a cross-platform Desktop App integrated 
with a .NET API backend utilizing Kotlin ServiceStack Reference to generate Kotlin DTOs that can be used with the 
generic ServiceStack Java JsonServiceClient to enable its end-to-end typed API integration.
