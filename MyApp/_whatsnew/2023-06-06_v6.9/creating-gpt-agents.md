We've been working on different patterns of development to enable ChatGPT to leverage an App's ServiceStack APIs 
to solve given tasks. This is done through various prompting techniques which allows the Agent to reason about the 
context of the conversation and make decisions to reach for different 'tools' (your APIs) when trying to achieve 
a specific goal.

For anyone wishing to incorporate AI into their systems we've created a introductory video into the techniques 
of how to leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT so they can make informed decisions on which of your 
internal APIs they should call to accomplish a given task described in natural language.
