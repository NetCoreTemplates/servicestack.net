Python has solidified itself as a powerhouse in Data Science and Machine Learning thanks to its
best-in-class libraries as well as being at the forefront of Interactive Computing with its native
support in [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) - a popular realization of Donald Knuth’s
[Literate Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming)
paradigm where executable code is interlaced in a live document with natural language
documentation, rich markup and embedded media. It’s become an invaluable medium for data
science, scientists and researchers where it’s often used as an advanced REPL environment
for data and computation exploration whose resulting knowledge and insights are easily
captured and shared.

We’re excited to be able to join the beautiful interactive world of Jupyter Notebooks with
both Simple UI and command-line tools for effortlessly generating customized Notebooks around
typed ServiceStack APIs for Jupyter’s premier support for **Python**.
