Part two in the series where we walk through a recreation of the TypeChat example build in .NET. 

We show how you can utilize various different Speech-to-Text services with the `ServiceStack.AI` and 
`ServiceStack.GoogleCloud` libraries, and pass that text to be processed by Microsoft's TypeChat. 

We demonstrate how TypeChat validates the output from OpenAI's APIs to ensure the JSON returned matches a specified 
TypeScript schema that is dynamically generated.
