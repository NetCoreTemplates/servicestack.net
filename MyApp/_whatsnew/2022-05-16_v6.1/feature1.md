We're excited to announce [Locode](/locode), our **Rapid Application Development** solution to quickly develop
beautiful Full Stack CRUD Apps around **AutoQuery APIs**, suitable for a wide number of use-cases including:

- Rapid prototyping by creating an instant UI around existing **Database-First** RDBMS tables
- Declarative **Code-First** development model with unprecedented customizability (exportable from Database-First)
- **Hybrid Apps** with a custom UI to optimize common workflows whilst using Locode's Auto UI to manage Back office tables

As Locode's UI is built on top of ServiceStack's industrial strength AutoQuery APIs, Hybrid Apps can benefit from its superior end-to-end typed development model for creating Web, Mobile & Desktop Apps.
