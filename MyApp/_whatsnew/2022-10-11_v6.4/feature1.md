We're excited to announce exciting new Blazor Components enabling a compelling a Rapid Application Development platform for Blazor Apps delivering many of the productivity benefits previously limited to [locode.dev](https://www.locode.dev).

Our new native Blazor Components allows for a beautiful progression story where you can start with a [Database-First Locode](/locode/database-first) solution to instantly [generate Data Models and CRUD APIs](/locode/database-first#exporting-to-code-first-types) around your existing databases that thanks to the new `AutoQueryGrid` Blazor component will be able to trivially implement both CRUD UI's and optimized Blazor UIs in the same Blazor App.
