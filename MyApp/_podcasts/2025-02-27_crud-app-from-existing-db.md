This episode covers a system for automatically generating CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) APIs and 
administrative user interfaces from an existing relational database.  

The process begins by extracting metadata from the database using an AppTask and an RDBMS connection. 
This metadata is then used to create TypeScript data models, which serve as blueprints for code generation.  

These models are further customizable, allowing for adjustments before generating the APIs, UIs, 
and database migrations.  

Finally, a command-line tool (`okai`) facilitates the generation and allows for real-time code updates 
using a watch feature. The system leverages TypeScript for its flexibility and strong typing capabilities.
