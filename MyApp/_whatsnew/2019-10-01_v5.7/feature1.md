Ordinarily we'd have a longer release cadence in between releases with more features, but with the recent release of .NET Core 3
we've cut this release cycle short so we can release a version of ServiceStack compatible with .NET Core 3+. Other than that the major focus
on this release was `#Script` with [many new features](https://docs.servicestack.net/releases/v5.7#script) we're excited to share after covering the ServiceStack changes.
