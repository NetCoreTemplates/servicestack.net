This episode analyzes the cost efficiency and performance of ARM vs. x86 architectures for 
running .NET applications on cloud providers such as Hetzner, AWS, and Azure and compares 
different instance types and conducts benchmarks using pgbench, a .NET HTTP load test, 
and Geekbench scores. 

The results highlight the potential cost savings of using ARM, especially for scalable 
web services and workloads which emphasizes that Hetzner offers a more value-focused 
approach with lower costs, while AWS and Azure provide a wider range of managed services. 

Ultimately, the choice between ARM and x86, and between providers, depends on factors 
such as workload requirements, scalability needs, and budget constraints.
