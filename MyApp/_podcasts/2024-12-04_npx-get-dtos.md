This episode covers a new npm script, `npx get-dtos`, that simplifies accessing ServiceStack APIs. 

This script allows downloading Typed DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) in various programming languages 
without requiring a .NET installation. It offers similar functionality to the existing `x` dotnet tool, 
providing a more flexible alternative, especially for CI environments. 

The script supports multiple languages, and examples are given using TypeScript and C#. 
A key advantage is the reusability of generated DTOs across different API instances. 
The blog post also highlights its use with OpenAI Chat and Ollama APIs as a practical application.
