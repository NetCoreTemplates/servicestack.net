This episode talks about how to create a voice-activated coffee shop application using .NET
and the process of implementing voice transcription, using GPT to convert natural language orders 
into machine-readable instructions, and leveraging TypeChat for schema-based order validation. 
It explores various speech-to-text providers, including Google Cloud, Amazon Transcribe, 
Azure AI Speech, and OpenAI Whisper. 

It also discusses the use of local OpenAI Whisper and Llama.cpp for running LLMs locally, 
highlighting the challenges and opportunities associated with this approach and concludes with 
a discussion of future .NET implementations for TypeChat's different GPT examples.
