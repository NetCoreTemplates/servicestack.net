The goal of our increasing Blazor investments is to enable a highly productive and capable platform for rapidly developing a majority of internal Apps CRUD functionality as well as enabling a hybrid development model where the management of Back office supporting tables can be quickly implemented using custom AutoQueryGrid components freeing up developers to be able to focus a majority of their efforts where they add the most value - in the bespoke Blazor UI's optimized customer-facing UX.

To best demonstrate its potential we've created [blazordiffusion.com](https://blazordiffusion.com) - a new ServiceStack.Blazor App front-end for Stable Diffusion - a deep learning text-to-image model that can generate quality images from a text prompt. It's a great example of Hybrid Development in action where the entire user-facing UI is a bespoke Blazor App that's optimized for creating, searching, cataloging and discovering Stable Diffusion generated images, whilst all its supporting admin tasks to manage the back office tables that power the UI were effortlessly implemented with custom AutoQueryGrid components.
