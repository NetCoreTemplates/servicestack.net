An unintended consequence of **AutoGen** that's potentially universally appealing to even non .NET developers is that it's also a way to instantly
generate Types for all RDBMS tables in all of ServiceStack [supported client languages](https://docs.servicestack.net/add-servicestack-reference),
which thanks to being configurable in a [Sharp App](https://sharpscript.net/docs/sharp-apps) can be executed from the command-line using
the [dotnet tools](https://docs.servicestack.net/dotnet-tool)
