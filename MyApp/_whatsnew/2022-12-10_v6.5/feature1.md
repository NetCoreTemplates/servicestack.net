Tailwind has revolutionized how we style our Web Apps with its mobile first design system that's dramatically simplified creating maintainable responsive Web Apps. It also excels at adding support for Dark Mode with its first-class dark: modifier allowing the use of standard tailwind classes to specify what elements should look like when viewed in Dark Mode.

We're happy to announce that Dark Mode support has been added to **all ServiceStack.Blazor Tailwind components** and all Blazor Tailwind project templates where you'll be able to toggle on/off Dark Mode with the new **DarkModeToggle** component.
