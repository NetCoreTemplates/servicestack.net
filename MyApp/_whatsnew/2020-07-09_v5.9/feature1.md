Another exciting development in this release is the successor to [Admin UI](https://github.com/ServiceStack/Admin):
**ServiceStack Studio!** - a capability-based UI to manage multiple remote ServiceStack instances from either a Chromium Desktop App
or cross-platform .NET Core Web App.

The richer metadata in ServiceStack Services allows Studio to logically group Services around Data Models, enabling its high-level
semantic features like its native data-grid like UX over all AutoQuery Services to quickly discover, search, create, update and
delete entities based on the available AutoQuery APIs and whether Authenticated Users have access to them.
