We've also improved the development experience for developers who prefer or have existing investments in gRPC will be able to 
benefit from the improved development experience with **mix flutter-grpc** which works like **mix flutter** but instead 
adds a new Flutter gRPC App to an existing ServiceStack grpc project, with pre-configured gRPC integrations. 

To demonstrate this productive workflow we've [created a new video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgts6sQ2Ags) which walks 
through the process of creating a new Flutter App from scratch, adding a Flutter gRPC App to an existing grpc .NET project, 
and using **mix flutter-grpc** to configure the Flutter App to work with ServiceStack's gRPC Services.
