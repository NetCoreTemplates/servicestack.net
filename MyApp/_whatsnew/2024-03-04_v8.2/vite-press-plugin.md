The Vite Press Plugin is an alternative to VitePress for adding Markdown features to existing Vite Vue or React projects. 
It's a non-intrusive plugin for Vue and React Vite apps that want to add markdown powered content features without needing 
to adopt an opinionated framework for their entire App.

### Universal Markdown Features

A goal for vite-press-plugin is to implement a suite of universal markdown-powered features that can be reused across Vue, 
React and .NET Razor and Blazor projects, allowing you to incorporate same set of markdown feature folders to power 
markdown content features across a range of websites built with different technologies.

### Vite Apps with vite-press-plugin

The vite-press-plugin currently powers the markdown features in the static Vite Vue and React templates which are ideal 
for creating static websites, blogs, documentation and marketing websites that can be hosted FREE on GitHub Pages CDN
