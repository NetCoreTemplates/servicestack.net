We're starting off 2022 eclipsing an impressive milestone having crossed
[100M+ NuGet downloads](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/servicestack) which we're celebrating by making ServiceStack FREE for Individuals & collaborative OSS Projects.

We've also created 2 new community spaces for ServiceStack developers to engage with each other:

- [ServiceStack/Discuss](https://github.com/ServiceStack/Discuss/discussions/)
- [#ServiceStack channel on Discord](https://discord.gg/w4ayGbuYpA)

These new spaces are welcome to all users of the framework that we hope together with the new free licenses will encourage developers build and share their amazing creations with each other! ðŸŽ‰
