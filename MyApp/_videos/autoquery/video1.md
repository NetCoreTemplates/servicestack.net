In this video, we demonstrate how to use AutoQuery to turn a static XKCD comic dataset from Hugging Face into a Web API, 
addressing common issues of siloed data.

By creating well-defined AutoQuery APIs, we make the data more accessible and enable efficient data integrations 
for rapid creation of production Web Apps which we demonstrate in new lightweight a Razor SSG Vue App.
