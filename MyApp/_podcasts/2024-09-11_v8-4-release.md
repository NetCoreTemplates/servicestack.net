This episode covers the ServiceStack v8.4 release which introduces Background Jobs, 
a feature for queueing and managing background tasks. This feature leverages SQLite as a 
persistent store, providing robust, scalable, and infrastructure-free job management.
All existing .NET 8 Identity Auth templates have also been upgraded to integrate with 
Background Jobs for sending Identity Auth emails. 

The release also includes SQLite Request Logs support for persisting Request Logs into monthly
archivable rolling databases enabling a richer monitoring and logging experience. 

Finally, this episode highlights the recommended usage of SQLite in high performance scalable
applications with a number of OSS Apps built by ServiceStack, demonstrating the 
advantages of SQLite in web development.

### Getting Started

Create any new [Identity Auth template](/start) which is pre-configured with Background Jobs, e.g:

<project-creator v-slot="x">
    <project-template :name="x.text" repo="NetCoreTemplates/blazor-vue" :tags="['auth','vue']">
        <div class="mb-3 text-xl font-medium text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200">Blazor Vue</div>
        <template #icon>
            <img class='w-12 h-12' src="/img/svgs/blazor.svg">
        </template>
    </project-template>
</project-creator>

Alternatively create a new project with the [x dotnet tool](https://docs.servicestack.net/dotnet-new):

:::sh
x new blazor-vue ProjectName
