In this video tutorial, we demonstrate the steps required to create a bookings API that is designed to be easy to use for non-developers. To achieve this, we make use of the ServiceStack Locode and Admin UI features. With Locode, developers can easily generate a fully functional REST API with CRUD functionality. 

The Admin UI, on the other hand, provides a friendly user interface for managing user access, data editing, and dynamic validation. By utilizing these powerful features, developers can focus on implementing core business functionality while providing a highly intuitive API for non-developers.
