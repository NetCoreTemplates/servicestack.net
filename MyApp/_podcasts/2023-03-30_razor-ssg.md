This episode takes a look at Razor SSG - the exciting new project template for building static 
websites using Razor Pages and Markdown. 

It aims to offer a robust alternative to popular frameworks like Jekyll and Next.js, focusing 
on developer productivity and ease of maintenance. 

It enables developers to generate fast, CDN-hostable websites, and it prioritizes a 
smooth development experience, particularly within GitHub Codespaces. 

Razor SSG offers numerous built-in features like live reloading, custom layouts, and draft support, 
and it allows developers to extend these capabilities with custom Markdown features. 

Additionally, the framework includes a Markdown tag helper for hybrid Razor Pages, 
which allows for the inclusion of Markdown content within Razor Pages for greater flexibility. 

The framework's static site generation capabilities provide the ability to create dynamic routes 
and prerendered pages for optimal performance and user experience.
