This episode covers updates to the ServiceStack.Swift client library. Key improvements include a rewrite 
leveraging Swift 6 features and eliminating the PromiseKit dependency. 

The updated library offers improved compatibility and ease of use for developers.

The update facilitates multiple file uploads for APIs, such as AI Server's speech-to-text and image processing 
features. Examples showcase asynchronous file uploads using Swift's async/await and demonstrate calling 
OpenAI-compatible APIs like Ollama.
