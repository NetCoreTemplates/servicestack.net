The Redis Admin UI lets you manage your App's configured Redis Server with a user-friendly UX for managing core Redis data types, simple search functionality to quickly find Redis values, quick navigation between related values, first class support for JSON values and a flexible command interface and command history to inspect all previously run redis commands that's easily editable & rerun.
