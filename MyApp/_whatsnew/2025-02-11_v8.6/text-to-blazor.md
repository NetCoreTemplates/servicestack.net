We're excited to announce Text to Blazor - our first initiative for harnessing AI to help to rapidly 
generating Blazor Apps!

[Text to Blazor](/text-to-blazor) is a new online project creator that lets you generate a new Blazor CRUD App 
from just a text description. It queries 5 different high quality AI models to generate 5 different Data Models, 
APIs, DB Migrations and Admin UIs which you can browse to find the one that best matches your requirements.

Unlike most AI generators, LLMs are only used to generate the initial Data Models within a **TypeScript Declaration file**
which is the best format supported by AI models that's also the best typed DSL for defining data models with 
minimal syntax that's easy for humans to read and write.
