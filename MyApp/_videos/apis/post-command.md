[Post Command](https://docs.servicestack.net/post-command) is a collection of command line utils that lets you easily discover,
inspect and invoke ServiceStack endpoints from a single command.

Use [inspect](https://docs.servicestack.net/post-command#inspect-command) to discover features and APIs available on a remote
ServiceStack endpoint including the version of ServiceStack running, the Appâ€™s registered Content Types, Plugins and Auth Providers
as well as its public APIs, their routes and Response Types.
