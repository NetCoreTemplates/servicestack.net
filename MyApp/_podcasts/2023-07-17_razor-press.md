This episode looks at Razor Press - a free and open-source static site generator built with 
C# Razor Pages and Markdown that offers a fast and flexible alternative to popular tools 
like Jekyll and VitePress. 

Designed for content-centric websites and documentation, Razor Press features customizable 
sidebars, document maps, and auto-linking headers, alongside Markdown extensions for 
content includes, styled sections, and copy and shell command widgets. 

It allows for easy deployment on GitHub Pages and can be used to build websites like blogs, 
portfolios, and marketing sites. The project is based on Razor SSG, which is recommended 
for more complex projects requiring additional Razor and Markdown features, and 
both templates benefit from the flexibility of Razor Pages layouts and partials.
