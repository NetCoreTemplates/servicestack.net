This episode describes the development of a GPT Meeting Agent, a program that leverages 
OpenAI's Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate meeting scheduling. 

It discusses the use of Microsoft's Semantic Kernel library, which provides a more flexible 
and user-friendly way to integrate LLMs into applications and explains the advantages of 
using Semantic Kernel, such as its ability to simplify interaction with LLMs by treating 
them as functions. 

While the library is still in development, the authors highlight its potential to 
streamline development and enhance the user experience of applications that integrate with LLMs.
