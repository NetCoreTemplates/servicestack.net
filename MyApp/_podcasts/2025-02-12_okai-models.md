This episode covers "okai," a new npm tool for rapidly developing Blazor and Vue CRUD applications. 

okai uses AI to generate data models, APIs, database migrations, and admin UIs from a TypeScript declaration file. 

This declarative approach allows developers to define application features using a minimal syntax, 
then regenerate the application components as needed. 

The tool integrates with existing Blazor Admin or Blazor Vue projects and offers a live code generation feature 
for real-time updates. 

Developers can customize the generated code by modifying the TypeScript file and re-running okai.
