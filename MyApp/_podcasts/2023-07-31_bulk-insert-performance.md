The episode presents a performance comparison of different relational database management systems 
(RDBMS) when executing bulk insert operations within .NET. 

It measures and compares the performance of bulk insert implementations for various RDBMS, 
including PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, and SQLite, across three different operating systems: 
macOS, Ubuntu Linux, and Windows. 

It also analyzes the relative performance of different insertion methods, such as multiple rows 
inserts and single row inserts, in order to highlight the performance benefits of 
using bulk insert strategies when working with large amounts of data.
