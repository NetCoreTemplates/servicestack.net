This episode covers how to develop cross-platform applications using JetBrains' Compose 
Multiplatform technology. It emphasizes the ability to create native applications for iOS, Android, 
and Desktop platforms, while leveraging Kotlin ServiceStack Reference to generate typed Kotlin DTOs 
for end-to-end typed API integration with .NET backends. 

It then guides the reader through setting up an environment using either Android Studio 
or JetBrains Fleet, and provides instructions for creating new projects, updating DTOs, 
and running both the .NET API and Kotlin Desktop App.
