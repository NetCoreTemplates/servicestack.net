This episode discusses the addition of PHP as an eleventh supported language for the 
"Add ServiceStack Reference" feature. This feature allows developers to generate native 
PHP Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) for accessing ServiceStack APIs, providing a typed API 
experience for PHP developers. 

It then highlights the benefits of using typed DTOs for PHP applications, including the 
use of promoted constructors and annotations for improved code discoverability and scalability. 

It also mentions the availability of a PHP ServiceStack plugin for PhpStorm, 
which simplifies the development experience and then concludes by emphasizing the use of the 
JsonServiceClient library, which enables a smooth and consistent typed API development 
experience for PHP developers.
