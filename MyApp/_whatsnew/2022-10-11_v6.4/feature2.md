We're happy to announce our new Blazor Server App template offering a number compelling advantages over Blazor WASM, including:

- A superior dev model and debugging experience
- Improved live-reload and faster iterative dev cycles
- Full access to .NET Server functionality
- Better start times & UI responsiveness
- Less complexity from unnecessary client project or pre-rendering solutions
