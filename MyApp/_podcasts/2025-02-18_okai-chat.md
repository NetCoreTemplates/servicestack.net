The document describes "okai," a command-line tool providing free access to various popular large language models (LLMs).  

Users can interact with these LLMs via simple commands, choosing from a selection of free models or accessing 
premium models with a ServiceStack license.  

The tool supports model selection and lists available models, with usage limited to 60 requests per hour for free users 
to prevent abuse.  

The primary purpose is to offer developers a convenient, no-cost method for personal research and assistance using LLMs.  
The instructions include using the `npx okai chat` command and specifying models by name or alias.
