This episode covers AI Server's `OpenAiChatCompletion` API - an OpenAI compatible Chat API with ChatGPT and 
other LLMs like Ollama, the benefit of which allows developers to use its Typed DTOs and ServiceStack 
generic Service Clients to call any Open AI Chat compatible API directly, in all of ServiceStack's
11 supported popular programming languages.

This allows developers to easily integrate typed access to different LLMs into their applications.
Instructions are provided for each language demonstrating how to install necessary packages, download DTOs, 
and send API requests.
