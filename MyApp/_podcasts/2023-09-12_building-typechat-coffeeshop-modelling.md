This episode details the process of building a .NET application that models a coffee shop 
using TypeChat, an AI-powered natural language processing library. The application leverages 
the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable customers to order coffee using natural language. 

It outlines the challenges and techniques involved in designing the application, from crafting 
the data model to implementing the user interface and integrating with various API services. 

It also discusses the role of prompt engineering in optimizing the performance of the LLM and 
the use of #Script, a templating language, to dynamically generate the TypeScript schema for 
TypeChat and concludes by outlining the next steps in developing a functional voice-activated 
coffee shop application.
