to various AI services. It offers centralized management of LLMs, Ollama endpoints, media APIs, Comfy UI
and FFmpeg agents, distributing loads across multiple servers.

 - **Centralized Management**: Manage all your AI services from a single Admin UI
 - **Load Balancing**: Distribute loads across multiple servers
 - **Native Typed Integrations**: For 11 popular programming languages
 - **Synchronous, Queued, and Callback-based APIs**: For different use-cases
