This episode explains a method for deploying web applications directly from GitHub to a Linux server 
without using Kubernetes. The process leverages GitHub Actions, Docker Compose, SSH, and a 
Linux server setup with an NGINX reverse proxy and LetsEncrypt for routing, TLS, and 
certificate management. 

This approach provides a cost-effective and straightforward solution for deploying applications, 
especially those with low traffic or for proof-of-concept projects and describes the key components 
involved, including GitHub features, Docker Compose, SSH, and the Linux server setup, 
and provides a step-by-step guide to setting up the deployment pipeline. 

It also includes a practical example of deploying a .NET application, highlighting the use of 
Dockerfiles, docker-compose.yml, and GitHub Actions secrets and concludes by emphasizing 
the benefits of this approach, including reduced complexity, cost savings, and flexibility.
