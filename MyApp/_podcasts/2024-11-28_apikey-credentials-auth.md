This episode explores the a new improved authentication system for .NET 8 C# microservices using API keys. 
API keys provide persistent user sessions, eliminating the need for repeated key entry. 
An Admin Auth Secret allows administrators access to additional functionalities. 

The system supports both coarse-grained and fine-grained API key access control, enabling restricted access to 
specific APIs based on key scopes or API Key validation. 

This approach simplifies authentication for microservices like AI Servers, offering a streamlined alternative 
to more complex authentication mechanisms.
