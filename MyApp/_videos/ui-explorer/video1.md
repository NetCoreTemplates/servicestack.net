The entire API Explorer UI is driven by the rich metadata around your APIs typed Service Contracts and AppHost's registered plugins

It's built from the ground up with multiple levels of customizations, supporting both declarative & programmatic models
whilst also enabling rich interactive HTML Components to document each of your APIs & their Types
