The new Request Logging & Profiling UIs bring an invaluable new level of observability into your App, from being able to quickly inspect and browse incoming requests, to tracing their behavior from their generated events in the new [Diagnostic Source](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.diagnosticsource?view=net-6.0) capabilities added all throughout ServiceStack, which both power the new UIs and enables new introspectability from code where you can now to tap in to inspect & debug when each diagnostic event occurs.
