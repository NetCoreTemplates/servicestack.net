This episode covers the ServiceStack v8.6 which introduces "okai," a command-line tool leveraging AI to rapidly 
build Blazor applications. okai generates data models, APIs, database migrations, and admin UIs from 
text descriptions or existing databases, using multiple AI models for options. 

The system offers flexibility, enabling users to create models from scratch, customize generated code,
and manage code generation in real-time using a watch function.

The generated code is modular and easily maintainable, with features like audit logging and live code generation. 

Additionally, okai provides a free LLM chat prompt for developer research, accessing various AI models with 
usage limitations. The system uses TypeScript as a declarative language for defining app features.
