CreatorKit is a simple, customizable, self-hostable alternative solution to using Mailchimp for managing an organization's 
mailing lists, accepting newsletter subscriptions, defining customizable email layouts and templates and sending 
rich HTML emails to your Customers and subscribers using your preferred SMTP provider.

It also provides a private alternative to using Disqus to enhance websites with a threading and commenting system 
on your preferred blog posts and website pages that you want to be able to connect with your community on.
