This episode discusses implementing voice transcriptions and TypeChat GPT in .NET applications. 
It explores how to leverage TypeScript's type system to define the machine-readable model 
LLMs should return, instead of relying on complex prompts for ChatGPT. 

It details several examples, including a CoffeeShop application that utilizes a voice-activated 
agent for taking orders, and demonstrates how to integrate these features with various 
speech-to-text providers, storage providers, and even through C# and Microsoft's Semantic Kernel. 

Checkout the links to individual GitHub repositories for each example where you can 
explore and utilize these AI-powered features in your own .NET applications.
