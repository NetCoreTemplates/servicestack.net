[JetBrains Compose Multiplatform](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/compose-multiplatform/) builds on [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) - Google's modern toolkit for building
native Android UIs bringing it to more platforms, including Windows, macOS and Linux Desktops.

It offers a modern alternative for creating native Mobile, Desktop & Web Apps which can also leverage 
[Kotlin ServiceStack Reference](https://docs.servicestack.net/kotlin-add-servicestack-reference) for end-to-end typed APIs. We'll look at the latest [v1.6 Release](https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2024/02/compose-multiplatform-1-6-0-release/)
and use it to build a cross-platform Desktop App integrated with a .NET API backend utilizing and end-to-end typed API
integration.
