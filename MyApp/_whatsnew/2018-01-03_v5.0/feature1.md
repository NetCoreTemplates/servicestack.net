Historically ServiceStack releases are focused around "Major release schedules" published along with detailed Release Notes describing new features and changes added in each release. All packages are published together in "lockstep" with the same version number so the effort to upgrade ServiceStack projects can be done all at same time, with low frequency.

Whilst we want to minimize the effort for Customers to upgrade we also want to make any fixes or enhancements to the previous release available sooner as there are often fixes reported and resolved immediately after each release and made available in our [pre-release packages on MyGet](https://docs.servicestack.net/myget) that most Customers wont get until the next major Release on NuGet.
