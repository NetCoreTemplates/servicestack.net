Now built into every ServiceStack v6 App is API Explorer - an instant integrated Postman and Swagger UI alternative to quickly Call and Explore your APIs.

The entire API Explorer UI is driven by the rich metadata around your APIs and AppHost's registered plugins capturing greater knowledge about your APIs and is able to provide a smarter, richer and more optimized UX than what would be possible going through lowest common denominator specs like Open API.

With envious performance and unmatched customizability, API Explorer lets you easily incorporate gorgeous, rich, interactive API Documentation API Consumers will love who'll be able to read its source code in their preferred programming language and easily call from their existing Client Apps.
